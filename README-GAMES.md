## Inspiration
OG founder and resident Devrel, one of our team leads, sparked our members' participation in Ceptor Club's by sharing their success in a past Chainlink hackathon during a workshop at Cyberjam. Ceptor Club's mission is to elevate the Dungeons and Dragons experience, streamlining the character creation and game discovery process for users.

## What it does
Our enhancements include a Chainlink VRF-powered d20 die and an efficient game scheduler, streamlining party formation. We've also revamped the platform's design for an enhanced user experience.

## How we built it
React
Tailwind
MongoDB
Chainlink VRF
RemixIDE
Unity
NFT.Storage

We utilized React and Tailwind to craft pages and components. Our back-end is powered by MongoDB, and Chainlink VRF was used to ensure a random dice roll. Unity was employed to create a 3D die model that is stored on NFT.Storage.

## Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we ran into, considering that for the majority of our team, this was our first official hackathon, and for many others, it was their first time building on or with blockchain technology. Some of the biggest challenges we faced were scoping, other workloads, and team schedules. With members located across the globe, we had to document our work in Discord, Telegram, and GitHub to make sure everyone stayed on the same page.

For Nadia, one challenge she faced was trying to get the die to return the number that was facing up after the die was rolled. When she first tried using planes, the result would return as unknown. Then she decided that using cubes for each number was the best course of action and the results were displayed correctly.

Alan and Vince are still early on in their web development journeys, so there were plenty of challenges that came along with it. There were times were the back end would randomly stop communicating with the front end, so it took a lot of troubleshooting and teamwork to get through roadblocks.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
A lot of our members built on top of and interacted with blockchain technology for the very first time. Alan has mainly contributed to projects as a front-end developer but spent this hackathon getting more familiar with developing the back-end environment and making sure the two communicated with each other. Vince is a completely new developer and was able to build out the start of a game scheduler feature in a short time. Nadia is a creative tech student finishing her program and never worked with blockchain technology before. She also has limited experience with Unity but was able to push through and get the animation of the dice rolling how she wanted and returning correct results. Jason is an experienced developer but hasn't worked with Chainlink functions before. He was able to connect the dice model to Chainlink VRF using smart contracts.

## What we learned
Since this was the first hackathon for a lot of our team, we learned a lot about working under the pressure of tight deadlines. Many of our members joined the hackathon with less than half of the time to the deadline. We all learned the importance of asking the right questions for us to communicate our needs most effectively.

## What's next for Ceptor Club Games Team
Our team is committed to ongoing contributions to the codebase. Alan will optimize data handling and storage, Vince will continue to build out the game scheduler, and Nadia will further develop front-end and UI skills, fostering individual and collective growth.
