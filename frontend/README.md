> Imagine, creating a new D&D Character on fastcharacter.com (just a few clicks, lets go!), copy it into our website and BOOM! Having a custom AI generated avatar minted and saved into Dragons Mine for for your level 1 Dragonborn, all in under a minute! Download for free or save your character as NFT with a random secret/public mission. Are we having fun yet?

# Blockchain, Chainlink & IPFS

- Our database of dragonborn heroes is maintained as NFTs in our smart contract, with a nice royalty for our treasury in there. - [@Cromewar put a](https://danj-o.notion.site/Just-regular-NFTs-7e555cc179684be58edf002b0f5b645d) sentence or two and a link here. -

- In the past, we used Chainlink in our Smart Contract to provide VRF randomness. [Link](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xa41a00db6c90b969252b38580e36b5241c16de85) In the future we want to expand this random seed into unique image prompts, gameplay missions and DM/GM approved mission complete access control. [See Our Github Repo for mo'](https://github.com/DnDnDiffusion/scaffold-dnd)

- We used IPFS/NFT.Storage to provide decentralized, permanent and immutable storage for the image saved to NFT.

# Getting Started (for developers)

0. Tweet @fifestarr "We're just getting started! ..." and/or try out our [live demo](https://operation-dragonborn.vercel.app/) and leave us your [UX feedback here on Github](https://github.com/DnDnDiffusion/Front-end/issues) as an issue.

> follow these steps to run our front-end on your local machine.

1. Git clone this front-end `git clone git@github.com:DnDnDiffusion/Front-end.git`
1. If you want to contribute quickly, switch to the welcome branch and add your name to the guest list. Commit with your preferred "class name" `git commit -m "star druid"`, and then push the changes to welcome branch.
1. run `npm install` in the Front-end directory
   > see Front-end setup below
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000/` and enjoy!
1. Check that the back-end API is functioning by uploading the fastcharacter.com sheet pdf and generating an image.

   > replace this with a screenshot that's configured with our trained model.

## Front-end setup

> `npm install` from the front-end directory to install dependencies

First, run the development server from the front-end directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/getImage](http://localhost:3000/api/getImage). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/getImage.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Use the `utils/` folder to add general functions (such as generating prompts, or saving files to NFT.Storage)

# What should I build to improve the UI/UX?

Ideally, we have a frontend that:

- [x] Has a "download namedDragonborn.png" button so users that don't know about right clicking or screenshotting can easily get their picture onto their device.

- [x] Has a "Save as NFT" for permanant decentralized file storage

- [x] Has a "Connect Wallet" button to enable Save as NFT.

- [x] Displays form to send to backend for image processing ie. /getImage

- [x] Scrapes a PDF / sends a pdf to the back-end

- [x] Displays response of images (choices) for the users character avatar

- [x] Serverside API call to backend / back-up to nft.storage

- [x] After character selection, send and save chosen character with character sheet

- [x] Fully responsive hamburger menu and mobile-friendly
- [x] Image selection UX highlighting and features

## endpoint documentation

- [x] stuff about the endpoint

Our backend endpoint information sprang forth from the mind and cloud of Somya the Dragonborn Cleric. Here is a [link to our Documentation page on Notion, check out "Dragonborn Backend"](https://www.notion.so/danj-o/R-D-6575f7b14c5949c0b65215c052c21b17). Happy adventuring!

- [x] Somya & Tippi's advice about Front-end to back-end connection

Just do it! And ask q in the group :D

### Roadmaps

- [x] using next/Image everywhere instead of img

  - [x] using at least one cool next/Image feature

- [x] [poetic product roadmaps](https://danj-o.notion.site/Product-Roadmap-S-1-3-bd2480b5be144ba4bef2b8b26ba336fe) by Tippi

- [ ] collect emails and save to db

> make sure it sends to api like the other fields
> then, save the email to the db
> in the db you can have something like
> {

    email: <email>,
    useCount: <incrementing number>,
    ...etc

}

> then every time they run the app, you increment the number
> dataaa

# Common errors

Tippi had trouble connecting his local stable diffusion to the front-end and we couldn't integrate with the flask pdf uploader.

Thinking this is a good UI.

-- giving the words "level 1" to stable diffusion in the image prompt.
