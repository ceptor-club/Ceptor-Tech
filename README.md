- ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=
- AVALANCHE_FUJI_RPC_URL=

5. to compile the smart contract
   `forge compile`
6. to deploy the smart contract
   `forge script ./script/deployer.sol -vvv --rpc-url ethereumSepolia --broadcast --sig "deployAll()" `
   `forge script ./script/deployer2.sol -vvv  --rpc-url polygonMumbai --broadcast --sig "deployAll(uint8,uint8,uint8,address)" -- 0 2 4 0xB4e5136F4BADDdF23a720A14a6a0D0d60A5ee9ee`
   `npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia `
   `forge script ./script/deployer.sol -vvv --rpc-url polygonMumbai --broadcast --sig "postDeploy(address,address,address,address,address)" -- 0x557d4b0a566613f344E2F5a9bc4FC52F6897B372 0xB4e5136F4BADDdF23a720A14a6a0D0d60A5ee9ee 0xf965217a040cc52354d55ed6D41112bb5f9Bf9D2  0x359A9d940692e09a318C1D690eb1cEDBBBb7E03f  0x45DB01904b51857F6279FE9006De25bf6dE8d136  `
   where addresses are in the following order address prompt, address dice, address ceptor , address ccid,address reward

## üñ•Ô∏è Let's Setup Backend

1. Go to Backend folder

   `cd backend`

2. Install all the dependencies

   `npm install`

3. Clone .env.example to .env
