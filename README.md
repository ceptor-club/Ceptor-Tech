Todo:
- [x] Provide a quick start guide for devs and judges
- [x] Explain the 3 teams (Art + Tech + Games) and how they work together
- [ ] High level overview of Ceptor Club and our goal for this hackathon / future
- [ ] Onboard all 3 teams to this repo
- [ ] Add Art, Tech, and Games pages to the navbar and front-end.

### We are providing a unified codebase for all 3 teams and clear documentation for the judges:

Each team will have their own branch to show their individual contributions to this codebase. The main branch will be the final product.

Each team will have their own narrative, demo video, internal page and readme linked below.

> As Team Tech, we will oversee the technical polish and powerfully use Chainlink‚Äôs flagship services.  We developed a login flow with monetization, crosschain compatiblity, and access control.  We use Price Feeds, Automation, Functions, VRF, and CCIP.  Tippi wants to prepare Ceptor Club to launch a BETA in Q1 next year and see some revenue.  

## Ceptor Tech is:

- Tippi (Product Owner and CCID/CCIP Developer)
- Eman (Chainlink Developer Expert -- Functions, Automation, VRF)
- Alica (PM and Designer)
- Lena (Web3 Fullstack with a heart of gold)
- Aire (Front-end support)

### Ceptor Art (Artour)

> Team Art (Artour) will support overall branding and help with our demo videos/team narratives, in addition to creating an end-to-end session zero experience following character creation. They are making sure our app and images generation looks good.
