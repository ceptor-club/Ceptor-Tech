# Ceptor Club Tech Team - Constellation - A CHAINLINK HACKATHON | NOV 8 – DEC 10

Todo:

- [x] Provide a quick start guide for devs and judges
- [x] Explain the 3 teams (Art + Tech + Games) and how they work together
- [x] High level [overview of Ceptor Club and our goal for this hackathon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzb8Nj6E7Tyr8YrIWLrJBskozBuCecXe3IotgcpygKo/edit?usp=sharing) / future
- [x] Onboard all 3 teams to this repo
- [ ] Add Art, Tech, and Games pages to the navbar and front-end.

### We are providing a unified codebase for all 3 teams and clear documentation for the judges:

Each team will have their own branch to show their individual contributions to this codebase. The main branch will be the final product.

Each team will have their own narrative, demo video, internal page and readme linked below.

> As Team Tech, we will oversee the technical polish and powerfully use Chainlink’s flagship services.  We developed a login flow with monetization, crosschain compatiblity, and access control.  We use Price Feeds, Automation, Functions, VRF, and CCIP.  Tippi wants to prepare Ceptor Club to launch a BETA in Q1 next year and see some revenue.

2. It will create three folders: `backend` and `frontend` (and `smart_contracts`).

## 🧑‍💻 Let's Setup Frontend First

1. Go to frontend folder

   `cd frontend`

2. Install dependencies

   `npm install`

3. Clone .env.sample to .env

   `cp .env.sample .env`

4. Setting up .env variables

   - Setting up Network and Chain Id

     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=goerli`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=5`

   - Setting up Alchemy API Key

     - Go to [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/) and create an account(if you don't have one already)
     - Create a new project based on your `NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK` variable and copy the API Key
     - Paste the API Key in `.env` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY=https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/4nxF5nQMK20uGJinU_sample`

   - Setting up WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID for wallet authentication -

     - Go to [WalletConnect Dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app) and create an account(if you don't have one already)
     - Create a new project and copy the API Key
     - Paste the API Key in `.env` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=f88d2c49_sample`

   - Setting up OPENAI_API_KEY (optional)

     - Go to [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create an account(if you don't have one already)
     - Create a new project and copy the API Key
     - Paste the API Key in `.env` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-<34f34qw_sample>`

   - Setting up NFT.storage api for storing images on IPFS

     - Go to [NFT.storage Dashboard](https://nft.storage/) and create an account(if you don't have one already)
     - Create a new project and copy the API Key
     - Paste the API Key in `.env` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_STORAGE=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI_sample`

5. Run the frontend

   `npm run dev`

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result and enjoy!

   `Need to setup backend now to see the full functionality of the frontend, if already setup then skip to step 7`

7. Check that the back-end API is functioning by uploading the fastcharacter.com sheet pdf and generating an image.

## 🖥️ Let's Setup smart contract

1. Go to Backend folder

   `cd smart_contracts`

2. Install all the dependencies

   `npm install`
   `forge install`

3. Clone .env.example to .env

   `cp .env.example .env`

4. Setting up .env variables

- PRIVATE_KEY=
- ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=
- AVALANCHE_FUJI_RPC_URL=

5. to compile the smart contract
   `forge compile`
6. to deploy the smart contract
   `forge script ./script/deployer.sol -vvv --rpc-url ethereumSepolia --broadcast --sig "deployAll()" `
   `forge script ./script/deployer2.sol -vvv  --rpc-url ethereumSepolia --broadcast --sig "deployAll(uint8,uint8,uint8,address)" -- 0 2 4 0x6fBcC51a9fCFe22181c1C299bfbE0b424BCE1d1a`
   `npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia `
   `forge script ./script/deployer.sol -vvv --rpc-url ethereumSepolia --broadcast --sig "postDeploy(address,address,address,address,address)" -- 0x0346FD18AeE90dC45472cdF71b55A698c91C3834 0x6fBcC51a9fCFe22181c1C299bfbE0b424BCE1d1a 0xFF5c16cF21E78304D74C6BE9C87272F000D8f948  0xE69a3a4fd7BA3c99d114c5ff032867F5Ace680da  0xAB71AF2Fb75d506b2aB5008F41032349eBB409F9  `
   where addresses are in the following order address prompt, address dice, address ceptor , address ccid,address reward

## 🖥️ Let's Setup Backend

1. Go to Backend folder

   `cd backend`

2. Install all the dependencies

   `npm install`

3. Clone .env.example to .env

   `cp .env.example .env`

4. Setting up .env variables

   - For ALCHEMY_API_KEY use the same key as in frontend
   - Setup API_KEY="testKey" for Socket io connections
   - Setup DB_CONN_STRING=mongodb+srv://verinta:BFWmxukoOsNdIx4x@ceptorclub.rq4oohp.mongodb.net/ for db connection

5. Renable CORS object

6. Run the backend

Put the connection string: `mongodb+srv://ceptorclub:dajfMXIwMzwM8ssI@ceptor.pgtoahq.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority` into mongodb compass and see the db

GET /user?wallet=<wallet0x> will give you the user
POST /user with
